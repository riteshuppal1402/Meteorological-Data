##Performing Analysis of Meteorological Data.

In this project, we will be performing the analysis to test the (given) Hypothesis. The Null Hypothesis (Ho) is "Has the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming".
The H0 means we need to find whether the average apparent temperature for the month (say April) starting from 2006 to 2016 and the average humidity for the same period have increased or not. This monthly analysis has to be done for all 12 months over the 10 year period.
